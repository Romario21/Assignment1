B) In total there has been 9 commits
I used the command "$ git shortlog"

C) It was last modified:  Wed Sep 27 16:31:42 2017
I used the command "$ git log -p .gitignore

D) 
commit cb30d72a3d94c108f393c163a35c1cc9bf18ffca
commit 36a8e55e4bbdd171ab57d979e1a802d740f2db9b

E) 
1. It is a way of isolating the development activities of several
developers, thus its better serves work done in parallel
 
2. Allows for changes to be made by each developer (in development
branch) and later be verified and tested when pushed. (so basically
a sense of security of not messing up the entire project)

F) git status allows for inspection of the working directory and
the staging area. It tells if any modifications were made to any 
files in the branch. git log on the other hand simply outputs the
commits done, which can be printed out in several ways.

G) I would use " git log --follow Weapon.h"

H) I would use "git log --all --grep="file""

I)
1. Inheritence is when new classes(called derived classes) inherits
properties from another class(base/parent class). This is done in
order to reuse code and allows new classes to share data and 
functionality found in the base class.

2. Polymorphism occurs within the notion of inheritence, it is when
a call to a member function of an object will execute a different 
function, this all depending on what object(base or derived class)
is doing the call.

3. This is the concept of keeping data from being misused from the 
outside world. only cerain functions can modify and access data 
encapsulated in classes(under private).

--------------------------------------------------------------

7. I think the RoleGame prototype is using both of these object 
oriented principles. Polymorphism is being used when weapon 
object is created (base class) in main.cpp  and the functions 
executing are not part of the base class. Encapsulation can be 
viewed with the private string "name" in the class weapon, It 
cannot be directly accessed by the outside world only by get 
function and constructor.
